Since we launched Safety Check in 2014, more than a billion people have gotten the news that a friend was marked safe during a crisis. As Safety Check launches expanded in scope, we scaled our infrastructure to handle these events more efficiently and automated many of the manual steps previously required for activation.

I totally get the "marked safe" feature that FB has but if you weren't at that club, never been to that club nor had intentions on going to that club WHY ARE YOU MARKING YOURSELF SAFE? I swear it just seems like some people just want to be relevant every time something tragic happens and it has nothing to do with them! I understand showing your support but marking yourself safe as if you were there or been there before so there could've been a chance that you could of been there MAKES NO SENSE TO ME !

Chen was marked safe in Tel Aviv.
Oh wait, no such feature. Because when terrorism happens in Israel, it's OK.
There was a shooting next door to my old apartment. 3min away from where most of my friends and I live. I am fine. I thought all of my friends were fine. And then I heard the tragic news, my friend Alon was MURDERED. Not killed, not injured, but murdered. Just for having a beer at our neighborhood bar. It could have been me or you just the sam...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without doubt, this is one of the best features about Facebook. Thankful I can find out immediately that my friends in Kolkata are safe from Disaster. ‪#markedsafe‬

It's overwhelmingly sad that we've become so conditioned to the frequency of tragedies that social media now has a "Marked Safe" function. It's not a sad day for any specific group within our society - it's a sad day for humanity. Wake up. Any fear and hatred as a result of these heartbreaking events only adds fuel to the fire. Create love and there will be peace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All my friends have been marked safe since the tragedy this morning in Orlando. Thank you everyone for reaching out and for your concerns and prayers. Please continue to send them to the outrageous number of other families affected, 50 lives were lost and over 50 have been hospitalized. One of Kyle's friends, Drew Leinonen, is still unaccounted for. His mother has been all over the news asking for any information. If anyone knows anything please contact the proper authorities while we continue to pray that he is ok. My heart is heavy and aches for everyone in our community, this hit way too close to home.....We really need to stand together now more than ever.

So far, 178 of my facebook friends are marked safe. 178. That's 178 people I know personally, with whom I've studied, worked, traveled the world, had beers with, and engaged in equal amounts of silly and enlightening conversations over the past ten years. People I consider friends. People I love, people I have fell in love with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to everyone who has checked on us this morning. All of this is overwhelming.
To my Orlando friends, whether I know you well or not, seeing your name marked safe is such a sigh of relief this morning. My prayers are with everyone! If anyone needs me I'm just a phone call away. I love you Orlando, stay strong.

I am shocked that such a terrible event has happened to a place I call home, but I am relieved that so many of my friends were marked "safe". I am praying not only for my friends who live there, but also for all of the families who lost loved ones today.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A request to everyone... Until and unless u ensure someone is really safe plz don't make them as "SAFE"... Don't do it for the heck of it... Plz understand the seriousness and act wisely... I see a lotta them who are marked safe actually aren't and the ones tat hav marked them safe are unaware if they r really safe... Plz understand...

Dear friends who have watched/are planning to watch Dilwale, please don't forget to "mark yourself safe on Facebook" after you're done so I know you all are fine ;)

So disturbed and saddened by the Pulse nightclub tragedy. Thankful to see my friends in Orlando who are marked safe. I went to so many events this week and it's terrifying to think how vulnerable we are. I know we can't give into our fears and I'll continue to express myself and enjoy my freedoms. I just hope to God these senseless attacks stop!

friends marking safe is nowadays how u hear first of bomb attacks. in future if this trend keeps going on and our alarm clock is literally replaced with safety check notifications of loved ones, the fear of terror might make it harder to keep an open mind and the masses will be easier manipulated and fall for whatever agenda promises them more safety..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This has been a common occurrence recently: Immediately after a horrible attack kills many innocent people in Turkey, my FB feed pops up with one Marked "Safe" notice after the other. Even though this is a great feature by FB, I don't think the verbiage applies to Turks anymore, who don't feel at all safe after bombing have become a commonplace since last year. I'm not gonna bore you about how much the corrupt and despicable "government" there is directly or indirectly responsible for this ongoing carnage, but my heart hurts regardless.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I'm grateful that most of my Orlando friends have either messaged, posted, or been marked safe, my heart breaks for those of you who have lost friends, for those who woke up today having lost anyone they love, and for those who cannot simply have a night out without fearing for their safety and even their lives.
This piece by Trina Merry has always been one of my favorite bodypaint images. Simple yet with such a powerful message.
Love will conquer hate, even if hate seems dishearteningly rampant recently.
Sending so much love to all of you in Orlando.

I am so sick and tired of all of the hate that people have for others and manipulating a peaceful ideology to fit a radical, corrupt agenda. This hits close to home. Praying that all of my Orlando friends are marked safe today but distraught to realize that will not be the case for everyone.

Around the time this happened last night a big group of friends and I were out in Dallas dancing at gay bar and having an incredible time together. I cannot imagine something like this happening.

Woke up today to a snapchat from a Norwegian friend expressing disbelief and a notification on FB that two of my Florida friends were marked "safe". The connectedness of our world is astounding. When did life stop being so precious?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's so sad. At least 602 died, 130 missing, 12,492 injured, 25,376 homeless, 6,998 buildings destroyed, 2,740 buildings damaged and colossal damage of economy. I have at least 10 friends in Ecuador. According Facebook Safety Check, 8 of them have been marked safe and two still remains unmarked. However, one of them made a Facebook post about 11 hours ago. So he must be safe. But, I don't know anything about Humberto J Zambrano, who lives in capital Quito, Ecuador. Pray and hope that he is ok. My sincerest condolences for the dead and all out sympathy for those who have suffered and have been going through trauma. Let all of us pray for them. :-(

I promised myself when getting into the news industry that I would never become numb to the tragedies of this world that we so often report on. I never wanted to see them as just another crash, another assault, another shooting. As I prepare to go into work tonight, I'm numb for a whole other reason. A terrorist attack in my hometown. Friends and family having to be "marked safe." My heroic uncle who is one of the nine SWAT members who took down the gunman. It all seems so un...

Registration process marks significant milestone in FAA's safe integration of small UAS: Last month, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta and Secretary Foxx announced that the Department of Transportation would work to develop a process for owners of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to register their aircraft.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Registration will instill a sense of accountability and responsibility among UAS pilots, and also will prompt them to become educated about safe flying in the National Airspace System (NAS). For those who choose to ignore the rules and fly unsafely, registration is a tool that will assist us and our law enforcement partners in finding them.

Also, you do have the right to record but if you are distracting the officer you are putting his life in danger.

Brother, let me get an answer. How could a person be unsafe in a closed cemented building, miles away from the Bay of Bengal...?
Isn't it ridiculous marking ownself safe from "Roanu" living in Dhaka?
This pole can only be justified if a person marks him safe living in the coastal region. But unfortunately they might not even known to this new fashion, or having no electricity.
Let's pray for them rather then marking.
Thank you.

I’d like to encourage you to think about boundaries in your life. Think about your boundaries and maybe where you’ve crossed them with God. If you have crossed the line, turn around before it hurts you any worse. Boundaries are his kind way of marking out “safe places” for us to stay within.

Even if "technically" speaking, you are safe because you're halfway across the globe from it, it's a bit inappropriate since that feature was intended to alert friends and families of those who are in France about the status and safety of their loved ones.

I cannot understand why people are so uptight about seeing their friends or family mark themselves safe on Facebook. We don't keep in touch with everyone we know, so yes it was a sense of relief to see all my friends & family were safe despite the horrible tragedy. How is wanting to know that make one selfish? If me clicking a button to assure my peeps that I'm ok is dumb then well you coming online & writing a long ass status about it is absolutely the same amount of time wasted!! Mind your own business & stop being so judgemental! Go & help people if you want, we are doin the same n stop whining on Facebook!!!

Hi all, please can you share this.
MISSING PERSON !!
My Nephew left for school yesterday morning in Torquay and never arrived. He attends Torquay academy school. The police have been informed and they have been to several friends houses and neither of them have seen him. Police are still looking for him now and obviously there are growing concerns regarding his safety and whereabouts. His name is Mark o'rourke and he's 12 years old....

All I have are questions...Woke up this morning to multiple friends marked safe on Facebook, a very cool tool, but an alarming one... 50 dead in Florida, what the fuck?! What kind of American History class will my nieces and nephews have? Lessons polluted with multiple attacks on people, on students, on gays, on blacks... And a country that says little and does almost less... I am so torn and upset, and at a loss for what to do... Happy to hear my friends are safe, disturbed to know that any second, anywhere; your loved ones, your friends, strangers- can just be shot and killed so undeservedly ‪#prayforhumanity‬

This is insane. I grew up in Guayaquil. I've seen a lot of friends that live here marked safe on Facebook and really hoping the ones who haven't are ok.

Normally I stay out of politics and news media but this has been bothering me. I am not trying to minimize the attacks on Brussels by any means. Any loss of life due to violence is an atrocity. However, here is a list of all the terrorist attacks since Paris. I did not see the level of support for these countries as I did for Brussels even though there was the same loss of life. I only found out about the Ankara attack because one of my friends was marked safe on Faceboo...
