 Chen was marked safe in Tel Aviv. Oh wait, no such feature. Because when terrorism happens in Israel, it's OK. There was a shooting next door to my old apartment. 3min away from where most of my friends and I live. I am fine. I thought all of my friends were fine. And then I heard the tragic news, my friend Alon was MURDERED. Not killed, not injured, but murdered. Just for having a beer at our neighborhood bar. It could have been me or you just the sam...
 Without doubt, this is one of the best features about Facebook. Thankful I can find out immediately that my friends in Kolkata are safe from Disaster. ‚Ä™#markedsafe‚Ä¨

 Dear Facebook, we are not safe. To be more specific, we are not feeling safe in this era of dishonesty, hypocrisy and unscientific civilization. So, we don't want your ' marked safe' drama.
 Nisha Joshi is marked safe and she is driving south
 My BEST friend, and Godmother to my boys, was "marked safe" in Orlando, FL. My little brother escaped the Zombiecon shooting in Fort Myers, FL.

 It's overwhelmingly sad that we've become so conditioned to the frequency of tragedies that social media now has a "Marked Safe" function. It's not a sad day for any specific group within our society - it's a sad day for humanity. Wake up. Any fear and hatred as a result of these heartbreaking events only adds fuel to the fire. Create love and there will be peace.
 All my friends have been marked safe since the tragedy this morning in Orlando. Thank you everyone for reaching out and for your concerns and prayers. Please continue to send them to the outrageous number of other families affected, 50 lives were lost and over 50 have been hospitalized. One of Kyle's friends, Drew Leinonen, is still unaccounted for. His mother has been all over the news asking for any information. If anyone knows anything please contact the proper authorities while we continue to pray that he is ok. My heart is heavy and aches for everyone in our community, this hit way too close to home.....We really need to stand together now more than ever. üíú
 How amazing is social media? I was able to see that all my friends in Kumamoto were 'marked safe' within minutes of the earthquake.
 So far, 178 of my facebook friends are marked safe. 178. That's 178 people I know personally, with whom I've studied, worked, traveled the world, had beers with, and engaged in equal amounts of silly and enlightening conversations over the past ten years. People I consider friends. People I love, people I have fell in love with.
 Thanks to everyone who has checked on us this morning. All of this is overwhelming. To my Orlando friends, whether I know you well or not, seeing your name marked safe is such a sigh of relief this morning. My prayers are with everyone! If anyone needs me I'm just a phone call away. I love you Orlando, stay strong. ‚ù§Ô∏è

 This absolutely breaks my heart.. The first thing I see in the morning are notifications that I have two friends marked safe from a Florida shooting.. This is the second shooting in Florida this week, and 50 are dead..
 So disturbed and saddened by the Pulse nightclub tragedy. Thankful to see my friends in Orlando who are marked safe. I went to so many events this week and it's terrifying to think how vulnerable we are. I know we can't give into our fears and I'll continue to express myself and enjoy my freedoms. I just hope to God these senseless attacks stop!

 friends marking safe is nowadays how u hear first of bomb attacks. in future if this trend keeps going on and our alarm clock is literally replaced with safety check notifications of loved ones, the fear of terror might make it harder to keep an open mind and the masses will be easier manipulated and fall for whatever agenda promises them more safety..
 This has been a common occurrence recently: Immediately after a horrible attack kills many innocent people in Turkey, my FB feed pops up with one Marked "Safe" notice after the other. Even though this is a great feature by FB, I don't think the verbiage applies to Turks anymore, who don't feel at all safe after bombing have become a commonplace since last year. I'm not gonna bore you about how much the corrupt and despicable "government" there is directly or indirectly responsible for this ongoing carnage, but my heart hurts regardless.
 
 While I'm grateful that most of my Orlando friends have either messaged, posted, or been marked safe, my heart breaks for those of you who have lost friends, for those who woke up today having lost anyone they love, and for those who cannot simply have a night out without fearing for their safety and even their lives. This piece by Trina Merry has always been one of my favorite bodypaint images. Simple yet with such a powerful message. Love will conquer hate, even if hate seems dishearteningly rampant recently. Sending so much love to all of you in Orlando.

 Woke up today to a snapchat from a Norwegian friend expressing disbelief and a notification on FB that two of my Florida friends were marked "safe". The connectedness of our world is astounding. When did life stop being so precious?
 It's so sad. At least 602 died, 130 missing, 12,492 injured, 25,376 homeless, 6,998 buildings destroyed, 2,740 buildings damaged and colossal damage of economy. I have at least 10 friends in Ecuador. According Facebook Safety Check, 8 of them have been marked safe and two still remains unmarked. However, one of them made a Facebook post about 11 hours ago. So he must be safe. But, I don't know anything about Humberto J Zambrano, who lives in capital Quito, Ecuador. Pray and hope that he is ok. My sincerest condolences for the dead and all out sympathy for those who have suffered and have been going through trauma. Let all of us pray for them. :-(

 Registration process marks significant milestone in FAA's safe integration of small UAS: Last month, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta and Secretary Foxx announced that the Department of Transportation would work to develop a process for owners of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to register their aircraft.
 Registration will instill a sense of accountability and responsibility among UAS pilots, and also will prompt them to become educated about safe flying in the National Airspace System (NAS). For those who choose to ignore the rules and fly unsafely, registration is a tool that will assist us and our law enforcement partners in finding them.
 If you mark yourself as safe, friends will receive a notification.
