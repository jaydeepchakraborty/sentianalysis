 Logged into FB & read about the tragic attack in Paris and friends being marked safe despite the fact that they are nowhere near the place.
 I hate that we live in a world where there's a need for a Facebook button for "friends marked safe."

 Didn't know Paris got attacked until some of my friends marked themselves as "safe" on FB :-/
 Facebook notification tht all friends near Paris were marked safe. That's wat I woke up to. Took me a few mins to realise wat was happening.
 Meanwhile on facebook, people marked as safe in Paris but they're not even in France. *sigh
 Facebook just informed me one of my friends marked himself as "safe" in the Paris terrorist attack. This is the world we live in...
 Also, shoutout to the idiots changing their locations on FB to "Paris, France" so they could be marked safe.  
 Wait. Someone on my Facebook marked themselves as safe in Paris and I KNOW their ass is right the fuck in Georgia.
 Grateful for Facebook's "friends marked safe" feature; devastated that a feature like this even has to exist. 
 why people marked their selfs safe even though they are not in Paris and the truth is they are in the other side of the earth.
 27 of my Facebook friends are marked safe and they're not even from Paris. Okay. Atleast, they're safe.
 LMAO, can we speak about this Facebook notification bout a girl was 'marked safe' during Paris terror attacks. She live inna portmore.
 I have notifications that some of my friends were "marked as safe from Paris terror attacks."But in reality.They don't really live in Paris.

 That marked safe option on Facebook is actually to let friends and family members know who is safe don't use it if you're in Texas as a joke
 "Friends marked safe" is both relieving and a huge reminder that we sadly live in a world where an option like that is necessary.

 @Meganlizbrown I know it's insane, I know so many people who live in Paris on Feb, there's an "marked safe" column in a Paris Attacks group
