 I totally get the "marked safe" feature that FB has but if you weren't at that club, never been to that club nor had intentions on going to that club WHY ARE YOU MARKING YOURSELF SAFE? I swear it just seems like some people just want to be relevant every time something tragic happens and it has nothing to do with them! I understand showing your support but marking yourself safe as if you were there or been there before so there could've been a chance that you could of been there MAKES NO SENSE TO ME !

 Normally I stay out of politics and news media but this has been bothering me. I am not trying to minimize the attacks on Brussels by any means. Any loss of life due to violence is an atrocity. However, here is a list of all the terrorist attacks since Paris. I did not see the level of support for these countries as I did for Brussels even though there was the same loss of life. I only found out about the Ankara attack because one of my friends was marked safe on Faceboo...

 Wow, this is so crazy. Facebook notified me that my friends near Orlando have been marked safe.. 
 I started crying when I saw my best friend marked herself safe on Facebook. I hate that we even have to do this.

 Every time these marked safe notifications hit my phone I get more and more pissed
 I'm getting notifications on FB that my friends/fam in Orlando were "marked safe" lol wtf? Will you also tell me if they're marked unsafe??
 There's nothing just quite like having to watch and see if they people you know are marked safe from the Orlando shootings.
 Waking up to seeing my friends living in Orlando marked as safe scared the hell outta me.
 In my city...I get to watch my friends being marked as "safe". Why in the fuck do we need this?!? This is beyond... http://fb.me/7VJyb1Ocv 
 Bruh Facebook has this "marked safe" thing for anyone in the Orlando area to let u know they're ok
 Woke up to 6 Facebook notifications saying what members of my family were marked "safe" in Orlando..... Our world is so fucked up
 Woke up to my phone saying Bunni & Sade marked safe. I'm like wtf going on?Only to find out it was a mass shooting.  for those affected
 The notifications as friends/family are marked safe on social media gives quite the surreal/eerie feeling...This is the world we live in.
 We live in a world where Facebook needs a "marked safe" function. Let's all stop and think about that.
 I hate this. I hate that I just opened Facebook to see which of my Orlando friends marked themselves as safe. I feel sick.
 I absolutely hate that I have to check FB to see who is marked as "safe" and who isn't. But I'm… https://www.instagram.com/p/BGj3aZvH7SQ/

 Most of my friends on FB that live in Orlando have been marked safe, I'm glad for that
 @flacaa_23 it lets people who live around the area of Orlando marked safe. it's whenever a natural disaster or for this case, a shooting.
 Just experienced FB's "marked safe" feature used legitimately for the first time. More than makes up for all the idiots using it as a joke.
 Getting a lot of "marked safe" notifications on FB. Grateful for that, but this should not be a part of our existence. Just shaking.
 When u realize how much ppl u know in Orlando when u get all these fb notifications of marked safe
 Wow. We now live in world where  these types of tragedies happen so frequently FB has "marked safe" notification 
 @cpburkejr I keep getting the "marked safe" notifications from friends in Orlando and I'm just so upset that I even have to feel relieved??
 Wow didn’t even know that Facebook has a “Marked Safe” feature for people living in Orlando
 it's so sad that this is actually a thing; having to be "marked safe" like this shouldn't even be an issue 
 the fact that Facebook even needs a "marked safe" button is ridiculous no????? but good thing social media is quick to act I guess????
 It's an effed up world we live in when the new norm is to be Marked Safe after terrorist attacks.

 I'm somewhat glad for the "marked safe" feature on FB, but at the same time, I wish it wasn't something that even had to be used.
 The fact that Facebook even has a "marked safe" feature is heartbreaking. #PulseNightclub
 A shame that safe spaces can't even be safe these days. The one place where your authenticity can shine is now marked by tragedy.
 It's crazy how FB is sending me notifications of my friends being "marked safe" from the shooting in Orlando. I hate this. We need change.

 I'm glad Facebook has the Marked Safe feature for people that were near a casualty
 My uncle just marked himself safe in the Orlando shooting. Relieved, but infuriated that we live like this. 
 I hate that the "X friend has marked herself safe from the shooting in Orlando" notification has to be a thing
 Know someone in Orlando who is marked as "safe" on FB. Useful function, but something dark about it having to exist and be used
 Loving how Facebook is keeping me updated on who's marked safe in Orlando after last nights shooting. It's a sad world we live in...
 One of my FB friends "marked herself safe" in Orlando and I got a notification. Is that not weird as fuck?

 "The list of people who marked themselves as safe are likely now on my hate list" - @AdamGalashan
 I think the Facebook 'marked safe' thing is a fabulous idea!!! If you live in Nepal
 Anyone who's "marked safe in Nepal" on facebook, even though I know for a fact they're sat safe and well inside my postcode need a slap
 Three of my Facebook 'friends' have checked in as safe in the Nepal earthquake & some idiot has marked themselves not safe. Honest to God.
 This whole marked safe thing isn't funny though is it cos people are actually dying nd u wouldnt make jokes if it had happened in Britain
 Nice to know people who live in the uk are "were marked safe during Nepal Earthquake" Thanks Facebook
 Wasnt even slightly worried about any of the people who have been marked safe post Nepalese earthquake. Mainly because they're no where near
 If you've marked yourself as safe on Facebook for being in the Nepal Earthquake Zone when you're not even there, you disgust me
 It's nice to know that you have been 'marked safe' from the Nepal earthquake considering you live in Glasgow
 Seen so many more people complain about the marked safe in Nepal thing than people who actually done it lol
 omg u marked urself safe from the Nepal earthquake even tho ur in Ireland oh woww ur so funny and cool and original
 ".... were marked safe" yes because you like in Hartlepool in the UK. Making a joke out of those who aren't is sick
 The "...... Has marked themselves safe" notifications are nowhere near as annoying as the amount of people complaining about them 
 All I keep getting is notifications saying someone is marked as safe on Facebook from the Nepal earthquake ....when they live in the UK
