Imagine there are 100 positive cases among 10,000 cases.
You want to predict which ones are positive
you pick 200 to have a better chance of catching many of the 100 positive cases

TN / True Negative: case was negative and predicted negative
TP / True Positive: case was positive and predicted positive
FN / False Negative: case was positive but predicted negative
FP / False Positive: case was negative but predicted positive

you count how many of the 10,000 cases fall in each bucket

TN: 9,760
TP: 60
FN: 40
FP: 140

What percent of your predictions were correct?
the "accuracy" was (9,760+60) out of 10,000 = 98.2%


What percent of the positive cases did you catch?
the "recall" was 60 out of 100 = 60%
What percent of positive predictions were correct? 
the "precision" was 60 out of 200 = 30%


Problem statements:
1) feature extraction algorithm
2) how nltk.classify.apply_features is working and what is the output
